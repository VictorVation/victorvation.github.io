Twelve hours earlier, I hadn't heard of the event yet. I had an amazing weekend, and it was a ton of fun. Here's a timeline of my unconventional journey to PennApps.\n\nThursday, 7:38 p.m., simultaneous messages from two colleagues:\nWant to go to PennApps? Don't worry about the waitlist, we can take care of it.\nThursday, 11:31 p.m.\nWe got you in. Just show up tomorrow play it cool on the bus.\nThursday, 11:51 p.m., an email to my boss:\nHey man, I'm gonna be away tomorrow. Sorry for the short notice. Here's my scrum update: [‚Ä¶]\nFriday, 8:17 a.m., on the PennApps bus:\nYou're not on the list. And you don't even go to this school.\nI was a last minute addition, <director> said I could take this bus.\nFine. You'll have to let everyone else get on first.\nFriday, 8:22 a.m.\nYou can get on.\nFriday, 9:08 a.m.\nTwelve hours ago you didn't even know you were going, and now you're on a bus to Philadelphia. Do you usually not tell your parents when you're leaving the country?\nFriday, 11:48 a.m., near the Canadian-US border\nWe are now approaching the border. The border service agent will ask you what the purpose of your trip is. The purpose of your trip is a programming competition. Do NOT mention hackathon‚Ää-‚Ääthey WILL freak out.\nFriday, 11:59 a.m., Canadian-US border, American side\nJust sent a snap of that American flag. I hope it sends, she's the only one in Canada who knows where I am right now.\nFriday, 7:47 p.m., Somewhere at the University of Pennsylvania\nHey man, do you know where Irvine Hall is?\nLooking for PennApps?\nYeah.\nOpening ceremonies is already over.\nFriday, 8:38 p.m., Registration, PennApps\nHi, [organizer]. I'm on the waitlist, but my friend [teammate] said to talk to you to have that changed?\nYeah, she told me. What's your name?\nFriday, 8:40 p.m., Adminterface, pennapps.com\nOrganizer changes me from Waitlist to Going.Friday, 9:53 p.m., Parts Checkout, three hours since hacking started\nDo you have any Estimotes left?\nWe don't, sorry.\nFuck.\nShit.\nFuck.\nSaturday, 12:04 a.m., Zero lines of code written\nAny other hack ideas?\nNope.\nWell then. Let's go skating.\nSaturday, 12:33 a.m., UPenn skating rink\nHow was the inspiration-skate?\nI've got an idea. Let's grab an Oculus.\nSaturday, 3:48 a.m., Several GB of SDKs downloaded later\n‚Ä¶This probably isn't possible on an unmodded Oculus.\nFuck.\nShit.\nFuck.\nI'm going to sleep.\nSaturday, 9:23 a.m., Towne 3rd floor, PennApps\nShould I set up a GitHub repo?\nNah. Save yourself the trouble of deleting an empty repo on\nSunday night.\nSaturday, 1:19 p.m., running an idea past the Postmates team\nAwesome idea. This is the first time I've heard someone use the API like that.\nGreat, thanks for the feedback. By the way, what about using it for prescription delivery?\nAt least fifty other teams are already building that.\nGot it.\nSaturday, 1:57 p.m., twenty minutes after we started hacking\nI actually have no idea what I'm doing. Let's start over.\nWant to write it with Flask?\nI've never used Flask before. Let's do it.\nSaturday, 4:30 p.m., a Skype message from my sister\nI want to get a new, cheap phone. Thoughts on a N5?\nGood choice. Also can you tell mom that I went to Philadelphia for the weekend for a hackathon? Thanks.\nSaturday, 10:38 p.m.\nThis isn't working out. Let's pivot. Again.\nWe have less than twelve hours left.\nExactly. We don't have enough time to finish this.\nPivoting commenced.\nSaturday, 11:45 p.m., deciding the domain name\nMaybe something evokes 'spontaneity' and 'serendipity' or even 'serenity'?\nYeah. Something that starts with an 's' sound and that doesn't have a harsh fricatives or tall letters.\nI'm not sure if you're sleep deprived or if I am, but I have no idea what you two are talking about.\nSaturday, 11:58 p.m., still deciding the domain name\nSpontaneity is definitely out.\nWhat? Why?\nNobody knows how to spell it, including us.\nSunday, 12:03 a.m.\nThe people at the next table are giving us looks.\nProbably because we discussed the sound-feel and pronunciation of our domain for half an hour?\nNah, that can't be it.\nSunday, 12:33 a.m., designing the UX of the landing page\nI think we should have a one sentence tagline.\nNah, three 'about us' bullet points is absolutely vital. You want to be clear.\nOne line makes it feel more luxurious. It draws you in, makes you want more.\nYeah, but three points conveys your message and explains it more effectively‚Ä¶\nSunday, 12:51 am, still talking about landing page copy text\nThey're definitely giving us weird looks now.\nSunday, 2:18 a.m., discussing our API\nMy API is like a roller coaster. Sometimes it gives you the data you want, and sometimes it gives you an internal server error and crashes node.\nThat's one hell of an API.\nOr one hell of a roller coaster.\nSunday, 3:56 a.m.\nI'm going to sleep. Wake me up in two hours.\nSunday, 9:27 a.m., writing the ChallengePost post\nThe post should be like a wishlist. As in, 'I wish I had implemented these APIs'.\nSunday, 9:30:00 a.m.\nOne tab of ChallengePost is telling me that I don't have permission to submit, and the other one is thanking me for my submission.\nAt least we're not the only ones with no idea what's going on.\nSunday, 9:34 a.m., checking out the Postmates API tag on ChallengePost\nWe might have a chance at the Postmates API prize. How many are there?\nThere are like four hundred other hacks.\nOh.\nSunday, 10:49 a.m., running through the rain to the expo\nMy boots are ruined and gross from the rain. I'm just going to throw them out.\nDo you have other shoes you can wear?\nI'll just wear my flip flops till we get home.\nSounds reasonable to me!\nSunday, 11:00 a.m., PennApps expo\nOpen the app both locally and on the website, on each of our computers. If one instance crashes, we can quickly switch to another screen.\nIt's a good thing there's spotty connection in here. We six chances to blame it on the internet.\nSunday, 1:08 p.m., eating lunch\nThere's that loud girl from the bus. Doesn't she remind you of a cranky middle-aged woman?\nExactly. The kind of person who is never satisfied. The kind that asks to speak to your manager‚Ää-\nThis place is pretty echoey. She can definitely hear you guys.\nOops. Good thing we don't have to take a 12 hour bus ride home with her, right?\nSunday, 10:38 p.m., five hours into the bus ride\nDid we already drop off people from the other school?\nYeah. It was when we were turning around a lot.\nThe most impressive thing I've done this weekend was to sleep through that.\nMonday, 1:12 a.m., Tim Hortons at the Duty Free Store\nJust so you guys know, we're out of food, we're out of bagels and bakery stuff, and our machine is broken so no iced capps or frozen lemonades.\nWhat else do you even serve? Apple juice and hot water?\nMonday, 1:25 a.m., near the US-Canadian border\nWe're a group of almost 40, and he is one border agent on graveyard shift by himself. Try not to be too loud or make sudden movements.\nIs he border patrol or a brown bear?\nMonday, 1:30 a.m., Canadian Border Services\nYou guys were at a coding competition, huh? Does that involve Linux?\nMonday, 4:07 a.m., Teammate's apartment\nAnd we're back. Time to sleep for three hours, take the subway home, get changed, grab food, and then get to work 30 minutes early."}},"/posts/welcome-to-ece":{"title":"Welcome to ECE","data":{"":"It was September 9, 2013. Early morning thundershowers had cleared to a gorgeously sunny day by mid-morning, and by 11:20 AM ‚Äî ten minutes prior the start time of the first university lecture ever for students of ECE 2018 8 Stream ‚Äî MC 2065 was filled to absolute capacity with slightly nervous, slightly sweaty, first year engineering students.With few people knowing what to expect, the prevailing nervous chatter noted that the professor was not actually there yet, even though class was about to start.At 11:30 AM sharp, a man walked into the lecture hall, strode to the middle of the room, pointed at a student in the front row and asked in an accent that would later be revealed to be Lebanese,\"Do you have a phone?\"Unsure whether or not this was something that he could get in trouble for, the student slowly nodded.\"Does it have a timer?\"Another nod.The rest of the lecture hall watched with rapt attention as the man pulled out a whiteboard marker from his pocket and instructed the student to measure the time it took for him the catch the marker after he threw it straight up in the air.\"2.431 seconds,\" the student read off his phone, after a nearly-missed catch.The man took a step back onto the raised dais at the front of the lecture hall, slowly observed the room, then addressed the entire class for the first time.\"Who can tell me,\" he boomed, \"How high in the air, relative to my hand, did I just throw that marker?\"A slight rustling of papers, but none of the students offered an answer.The man uncapped the marker and wrote on the board in large letters:y = 1/2 at^2 + vt\"Does anyone recognize this equation?\" The entire room, all of which had invariably recieved \"A\"s in high school physics just months before, nodded.\"It takes half the time of the entire toss for the marker to reach the top of the arc. At the very top of the arc, the farthest point of the marker from my hand, there is no more velocity on the marker, and the only force acting on the marker is the force of gravity. Using this, we calculate with what velocity I originally threw the marker, and from there, we calculate the displacement at the top of the arc, which is the range, in meters, of my marker throwing ability.\"The man turned back to the board, quickly solving the physics problem, and from there launching directly into a lecture on kinematics and dynamics.Fifty minutes later, the man dismissed the class. The students, dazed from their first lecture, quickly packed up. The nervous chatter resumed. As the volume level increased and students began to head towards the exits, the man's voice once again boomed through the commotion:\"By the way, everybody, my name is Mansour,\" he declared, introducing himself to the class for the first time.\"Welcome to ECE.\"Edited: Firas Mansour passed away on Wednesday, January 5, 2022. I dedicate this post in honor of the joy for life and spark of learning he inspired in all of us."}},"/projects":{"title":"Projects","data":{"":"","personal-projects#Personal projects":"Introducty.com.
