# My Unconventional Journey to PennApps
__Hacking the hackathon.__

On Friday, January 16, 2015, with less than twelve hours notice, I got on a bus that I wasn't signed up for, to attend a a hackathon that had already rejected me. I had an amazing weekend, and it was a ton of fun. Here's a timeline of my unconventional journey to PennApps:

__Thursday, 7:38 p.m.,__ simultaneous messages from two colleagues:
> Want to go to PennApps? Don't worry about the waitlist, we can take care of it.

__Thursday,__ 11:31 p.m.
> We got you in. Just show up tomorrow play it cool on the bus.

__Thursday, 11:51 p.m.,__ an email to my boss:
> Hey man, I'm gonna be away tomorrow. Sorry for the short notice. Here's my scrum update: […]

__Friday, 8:17 a.m.,__ on the PennApps bus:
> You're not on the list. And you don't even go to this school.
> I was a last minute addition, \<director\> said I could take this bus.
> Fine. You'll have to let everyone else get on first.

__Friday,__ 8:22 a.m.
> You can get on.

__Friday,__ 9:08 a.m.
> Twelve hours ago you didn't even know you were going, and now you're on a bus to Philadelphia. Do you usually not tell your parents when you're leaving the country?

__Friday, 11:48 a.m.,__ near the Canadian-US border
> We are now approaching the border. The border service agent will ask you what the purpose of your trip is. The purpose of your trip is a programming competition. Do NOT mention hackathon - they WILL freak out.

__Friday, 11:59 a.m., Canadian-US border,__ American side
> Just sent a snap of that American flag. I hope it sends, she's the only one in Canada who knows where I am right now.

__Friday, 7:47 p.m.,__ Somewhere at the University of Pennsylvania
> Hey man, do you know where Irvine Hall is?
> Looking for PennApps?
> Yeah.
> Opening ceremonies is already over.

__Friday, 8:38 p.m., Registration,__ PennApps
> Hi, [organizer]. I'm on the waitlist, but my friend [teammate] said to talk to you to have that changed?
> Yeah, she told me. What's your name?

__Friday, 8:40 p.m., Adminterface,__ pennapps.com
Organizer changes me from Waitlist to Going.

__Friday, 9:53 p.m., Parts Checkout,__ three hours since hacking started
> Do you have any Estimotes left?
> We don't, sorry.
> Fuck.
> Shit.
> Fuck.

__Saturday, 12:04 a.m.,__ Zero lines of code written
> Any other hack ideas?
> Nope.
> Well then. Let's go skating.

__Saturday, 12:33 a.m.,__ UPenn skating rink
> How was the inspiration-skate?
> I've got an idea. Let's grab an Oculus.

__Saturday, 3:48 a.m.,__ Several GB of SDKs downloaded later
> …This probably isn't possible on an unmodded Oculus.
> Fuck.
> Shit.
> Fuck.
> I'm going to sleep.

__Saturday, 9:23 a.m., Towne 3rd floor,__ PennApps
> Should I set up a GitHub repo?
> Nah. Save yourself the trouble of deleting an empty repo on 
Sunday night.

__Saturday, 1:19 p.m.,__ running an idea past the Postmates team
> Awesome idea. This is the first time I've heard someone use the API like that.
> Great, thanks for the feedback. By the way, what about using it for prescription delivery?
> At least fifty other teams are already building that.
> Got it.

__Saturday, 1:57 p.m.,__ twenty minutes after we started hacking
> I actually have no idea what I'm doing. Let's start over.
> Want to write it with Flask?
> I've never used Flask before. Let's do it.

__Saturday, 4:30 p.m.,__ a Skype message from my sister
> I want to get a new, cheap phone. Thoughts on a N5?
> Good choice. Also can you tell mom that I went to Philadelphia for the weekend for a hackathon? Thanks.

__Saturday,__ 10:38 p.m.
> This isn't working out. Let's pivot. Again.
> We have less than twelve hours left.
> Exactly. We don't have enough time to finish this.
> Pivoting commenced.

__Saturday, 11:45 p.m.,__ deciding the domain name
> Maybe something evokes 'spontaneity' and 'serendipity' or even 'serenity'?
> Yeah. Something that starts with an 's' sound and that doesn't have a harsh fricatives or tall letters.
> I'm not sure if you're sleep deprived or if I am, but I have no idea what you two are talking about.

__Saturday, 11:58 p.m.,__ still deciding the domain name
> Spontaneity is definitely out.
> What? Why?
> Nobody knows how to spell it, including us.

__Sunday,__ 12:03 a.m.
> The people at the next table are giving us looks.
> Probably because we discussed the sound-feel and pronunciation of our domain for half an hour?
> Nah, that can't be it.

__Sunday, 12:33 a.m.,__ designing the UX of the landing page
> I think we should have a one sentence tagline.
> Nah, three 'about us' bullet points is absolutely vital. You want to be clear.
> One line makes it feel more luxurious. It draws you in, makes you want more.
> Yeah, but three points conveys your message and explains it more effectively…

__Sunday, 12:51 am,__ still talking about landing page copy text
> They're definitely giving us weird looks now.

__Sunday, 2:18 a.m.,__ discussing our API
> My API is like a roller coaster. Sometimes it gives you the data you want, and sometimes it gives you an internal server error and crashes node.
> That's one hell of an API.
> Or one hell of a roller coaster.

__Sunday,__ 3:56 a.m.
> I'm going to sleep. Wake me up in two hours.

__Sunday, 9:27 a.m.,__ writing the ChallengePost post
> The post should be like a wishlist. As in, 'I wish I had implemented these APIs'.

__Sunday,__ 9:30:00 a.m.
> One tab of ChallengePost is telling me that I don't have permission to submit, and the other one is thanking me for my submission.
> At least we're not the only ones with no idea what's going on.

__Sunday, 9:34 a.m.,__ checking out the Postmates API tag on ChallengePost
> We might have a chance at the Postmates API prize. How many are there?
> There are like four hundred other hacks.
> Oh.

__Sunday, 10:49 a.m.,__ running through the rain to the expo
> My boots are ruined and gross from the rain. I'm just going to throw them out.
> Do you have other shoes you can wear?
> I'll just wear my flip flops till we get home.
> Sounds reasonable to me!

__Sunday, 11:00 a.m.,__ PennApps expo
> Open the app both locally and on the website, on each of our computers. If one instance crashes, we can quickly switch to another screen.
> It's a good thing there's spotty connection in here. We six chances to blame it on the internet.

__Sunday, 1:08 p.m.,__ eating lunch
> There's that loud girl from the bus. Doesn't she remind you of a cranky middle-aged woman?
> Exactly. The kind of person who is never satisfied. The kind that asks to speak to your manager - 
> This place is pretty echoey. She can definitely hear you guys.
> Oops. Good thing we don't have to take a 12 hour bus ride home with her, right?

__Sunday, 10:38 p.m.,__ five hours into the bus ride
> Did we already drop off people from the other school?
> Yeah. It was when we were turning around a lot.
> The most impressive thing I've done this weekend was to sleep through that.

__Monday, 1:12 a.m.,__ Tim Hortons at the Duty Free Store
> Just so you guys know, we're out of food, we're out of bagels and bakery stuff, and our machine is broken so no iced capps or frozen lemonades.
> What else do you even serve? Apple juice and hot water?

__Monday, 1:25 a.m.,__ near the US-Canadian border
> We're a group of almost 40, and he is one border agent on graveyard shift by himself. Try not to be too loud or make sudden movements.
> Is he border patrol or a brown bear?

__Monday, 1:30 a.m.,__ Canadian Border Services
> You guys were at a coding competition, huh? Does that involve Linux?

__Monday, 4:07 a.m.,__ Teammate's apartment
> And we're back. Time to sleep for three hours, take the subway home, get changed, grab food, and then get to work 30 minutes early.
